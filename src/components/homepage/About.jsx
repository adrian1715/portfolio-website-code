            I am a young Italian-Brazilian web developer, passionate about
            creativity and always willing to work on new projects. As I have
            always been interested in technology, programming attracted me for
            the first time when I was 15, mainly because of the enormous
            creative freedom it provides. Since then, I have dedicated myself to
            studying new technologies and developing different ideas and
            projects, from games to even websites and applications.

            I am a proactive and dedicated person, who is easy to get along with
            on a daily basis, and is always willing to help and learn with
            others. I aim to develop and contribute with my skills as much as I
            can to both the contractor and my own personal and professional
            growth.
